# Social Media App

This project is based upon the excellent [Full Stack React & Firebase tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_u6P5k0vP0) by Classed.

It is in two parts
1) [Back-End based on Firebase Cloud Functions and Firestore database](https://github.com/crazynayan/scream-tutorial). - This page
2) [Front end based on React, Material UI, Redux and React Hook Forms](https://github.com/crazynayan/scream-react).

The code and functionality is more or less the same but I did some changes to improve the code, 
bring it up to speed to modern standards (some concepts might not have been supported at the 
time Classed made this tutorial but now are supported) and use some different libraries to achieve the same objectives.

This approach helped me in learning a lot, and I would also suggest you to do the same.

## Major changes
Some major changes from the tutorial are as follows.
1) Using React Hooks instead of Classes and class life cycle methods
2) Using React Hook Forms
3) Using async/await  
4) Using Spread operator (...) - It is now supported in Firebase
4) Different way of arranging files in directory
5) Improved Reducers with a single return statement each
6) Fix the issue of comment count not updating immediately on comment. (Its state reducer needs to be updated)
7) Custom Styles are moved to global theme

## Objective
This source code is a supplement for those learning React using the Full Stack React & Firebase tutorial by Classed. 
If you get stuck implementing this project in your approach you can refer to this code and learn on different ways to 
implement them.
